# Building Desmume in VS19

Desume source code

I set the permissions for every possible user to have "Full Control" (so modify, read, write, read&execute") on windows on touch.exe and 7z.exe in the repo.

I then had to clear all the "Special Permissions" for every user for touch.exe and 7z.exe.
Then the build started to get past these problems, but still had some warnings and then was able to finish the build.
